# AI Observability with Arize and Phoenix - MCP Services Example

## Overview

This repository provides a practical example of implementing **observability on Model Context Protocol (MCP) services** using [Arize](https://arize.com/) and [Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/).

It demonstrates best practices for monitoring, tracing, and analyzing the behavior of AI agents and language model interactions through MCP services, enabling better understanding of system performance and debugging capabilities.

## Features

- **Tracing & Monitoring**: Track requests and responses through MCP services
- **Performance Analysis**: Monitor latency, throughput, and error rates
- **Arize Integration**: Send observability data to Arize for analysis
- **Phoenix Dashboard**: Visualize traces and performance metrics in real-time
- **AI Agent Observability**: Understand model behavior and decision-making
